        The creative coding lab is a monthly gathering to create beautiful art
        with code, visualize data, and learn from each other. The event is free
        and open to all: it's an opportunity to get creative together in a
        relaxed and friendly environment. Beginners and first-timers should feel
        especially welcome!
      </p>
      <p>
        As spaces are limited, please register here for the event (and
        deregister in case you can't make it anymore):

      <h2>What exactly will we do?</h2>

      <p>We'll meet for about 3 hours and code together:</p>

              Round of introductions, we present ourselves and what we want to
              work on. You can work on your project or do a tutorial for some
              technology you want to learn, see the
              <a href="#resources">Resources section</a> for inspiration.

            <td class="description">
              Coding time. Could be anything from a following a tutorial on how
              to draw lines in SVG, wrangle some data you saw on the Open Data
              Zurich site, draw a cool shader animation or flash 100 leds in the
              rhythm of the music with that arduino board you bought some time
              ago and never had time to code it.

          <tr>
            <td class="date">20:30 - 21:00</td>
            <td class="description">
              Presentations: in case someone wants to quickly share something
              that they learned or show what they did within the 2 hours.

      <h2>When and where will we meet?</h2>

      <p>
        I recently discovered a super cozy events space in Oerlikon and I booked
        it for Friday evening, <b>5th of July starting at 18:30</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.imgubelhof.ch/anfahrt" target="_blank"
          >Gubelstrasse 50, im Innenhof</a
        >. Please check the indications on how to get to the Innenhof

      <h2>Who is behind this weird idea?</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://raluca-nicola.net/" target="_blank">I'm Raluca</a> and
        I work as a solutions engineer at Esri, a company where we make software
        that analyses and visualizes geospatial data. I love coding visual,
        interactive experiences and I thought it might be fun to get together
        with other people, leave away our phones and other distractions and just
        code, learn from each other and discuss possible visualization ideas :)
      </p>
