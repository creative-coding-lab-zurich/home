        The creative coding lab is a monthly gathering to create beautiful art
        with code, visualize data, and learn from each other. The event is open
        to all: it's an opportunity to get creative together in a relaxed and
        friendly environment. Beginners and first-timers should feel especially
        welcome!
      </p>
      <p>
        The event is free of charge, but Raluca would be happy for a
        contribution (10chf) to pay the rental for the space.
      </p>
      <p>
        As spaces are limited, please register here for the event:

        (and deregister in case you can't make it anymore). And don't forget to
        bring your own laptop.
      </p>

      <h2>What exactly will we do?</h2>

      <p>We'll meet for about 3 hours and discuss and code together:</p>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="date">18:30 - 19:30</td>
            <td class="description">
              Round of presentations/discussions: show us your project or an
              idea you have or just tell us a bit about yourself. We have a
              large screen you can use to present.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="date">19:30 - 21:00</td>
            <td class="description">
              Coding time. Could be anything from following a tutorial on how to
              draw lines in SVG, wrangle some data you saw on the Open Data
              Zurich site, draw a cool shader animation or flash 100 leds in the
              rhythm of the music with that arduino board you bought some time
              ago and never had time to code it. See the
              <a href="#resources">Resources section</a> for inspiration.
            </td>
          </tr>

            <td class="description">
              Final chit chats (and help wanted to put away the tables üòÅ).
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>When and where will we meet?</h2>

      <p>
        I recently discovered a super cozy events space in Oerlikon and I booked
        it for Friday evening, <b>5th of July starting at 18:30</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.imgubelhof.ch/anfahrt" target="_blank"
          >Gubelstrasse 50, im Innenhof</a
        >. Please check the indications on how to get to the Innenhof
        <a href="https://www.imgubelhof.ch/anfahrt" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is behind this amazing idea?</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://raluca-nicola.net/" target="_blank">I'm Raluca</a> and
        I work as a solutions engineer at Esri, a company where we make software
        that analyses and visualizes geospatial data. I love coding visual,
        interactive experiences and I thought it might be fun to get together
        with other people, leave away our phones and other distractions and just
        code, learn from each other and discuss possible visualization ideas :)
