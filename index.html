      <p class="motto">
        The creative coding lab is a monthly gathering to create beautiful art
        with code, visualize data, and learn from each other. The event is free
        and open to all, regardless of age, origin, gender or experience. It's
        an opportunity to get creative together in a relaxed and friendly
        environment. Beginners and first-timers should feel especially welcome!
      </p>

      <h2>What exactly will we do?</h2>

      <p>
        We'll meet for about 3 hours and code together. This is a rough
        schedule:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="date">18:00 - 18:30</td>
            <td class="description">
              Round of introductions, we present ourselves and what we want to
              work on. We'll also have a challenge for each meetup. You can work
              on your project or try to solve the challenge. You can also team
              up with someone and work on it together.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="date">18:30 - 20:30</td>
            <td class="description">
              We work on our project. Could be anything from a following a
              tutorial on how to draw lines in SVG, wrangle some data you saw on
              the Open Data Zurich site, draw a cool shader animation, you name
              it.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="date">20:30 - 21:00</td>
            <td class="description">
              Presentations: in case someone wants to quickly share something
              that they learned or show what they did within the 2 hours.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
